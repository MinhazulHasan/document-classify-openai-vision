Cost Estimation Report for Image Classification API

1. OpenAI API Usage Costs

The primary cost factor in this project is the usage of OpenAI's API for image analysis. OpenAI's pricing is based on the specific model used and the number of tokens processed.

Model Used: GPT-4 Vision (assumed based on image processing capability)

Current Pricing (as of April 2024):
- Input: $0.01 / 1K tokens
- Output: $0.03 / 1K tokens

Note: Prices may change. Always refer to OpenAI's official pricing page for the most up-to-date information.

2. Token Usage Estimation

For each API call:
- Prompt: Approximately 50-70 tokens
- Image: Counted as approximately 85 tokens
- Response: 1 token (either "YES" or "NO")

Total estimated tokens per call: 136-156 tokens

3. Cost per API Call

Based on the estimated token usage:
- Input cost: (156 tokens / 1000) * $0.01 = $0.00156
- Output cost: (1 token / 1000) * $0.03 = $0.00003

Total estimated cost per API call: $0.00159

4. Pricing Strategy

To account for potential fluctuations in OpenAI's pricing and to cover operational costs, it's advisable to add a margin to the base API cost. A common practice is to multiply the cost by 2-3 times.

Suggested pricing per API call: $0.00477 (3x the estimated cost)

Round up for easier billing: $0.005 per API call

5. Volume Discounts

Consider offering volume discounts for clients with high usage:
- 1-1,000 calls/month: $0.005 per call
- 1,001-10,000 calls/month: $0.0045 per call
- 10,001+ calls/month: Custom pricing

Conclusion:
The recommended base price per API call is $0.005. This pricing strategy covers the OpenAI API costs with a sufficient margin to account for potential price increases and minor operational expenses.
